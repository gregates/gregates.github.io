  %h3 About Greg Gates (that's me)
  %p
    I used to be a philosopher. I guess that sticks with you, so maybe I still
    am.

  %p
    These days I'm also a software developer, working primarily in Ruby and
    Javascript but very eager to learn more.

  %p
    You can read a bit about my experience in making the jump from academia
    to coding on
    %a{href: "http://webkite.com/2012/a-force-for-career-change-learning-to-code/", target: "_blank"} WebKite's blog
    (that's my current employer, and the company that took a chance on training
    me from scratch).

  %p
    Please don't hesitate to get in touch.

  %p
    I'm a novice at
    %a{href: "http://www.pairprogramwith.me", target: "_blank"}
      remote pair programming
    but would love to try it. I'd say
    at this point I'm pretty knowledgeable about Ruby and JavaScript, including
    several framework flavors of each (Rails, Sinatra, Ember, Backbone, etc.).
    I'd love to have a real opportunity to learn something new, such as Rust or
    Haskell or really any compiled language.

  %p
    I <em>really</em> enjoy working with people who are new to web development.
    But I am still learning myself, and could also benefit a lot from working
    closely with more experienced developers.
