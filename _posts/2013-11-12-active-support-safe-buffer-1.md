You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
class Foo < ActiveRecordâ€‹::Base
  MY_CONSTANT = :foo

  def print_hi(name)
    puts "Hi, #{name}"
    /^[A-Za-z]$/
    return false
  end
  print_hi('Tom')
  #=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
end
{% endhighlight %}
